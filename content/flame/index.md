To quote their inventor, Brendan Gregg, [flamegraphs](http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html) are a visualization of profiled software, allowing the most frequent code-paths to be identified quickly and accurately. Clinic.js Flame is specifically for Node.js and is built into Clinic.js. It collects metrics using by CPU sampling, then tracks top-of-the-stack frequency and creates flamegraphs.

A flamegraph is an aggregated visualization of stacks sampled over time. It primarily visualizes two metrics. The amount of time a function was on CPU, and the amount of time a function top of stack. The last function to be called is referred to as being at the top of the stack. If a function is observed being at the top of stack more times than other functions, this function may be blocking the event loop. If a function is observed as being at the top of the stack in higher ratio it's referred to as being "hot".
